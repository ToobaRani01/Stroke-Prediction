🚑 Stroke Prediction with Machine Learning
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, caused by interrupted blood flow to the brain. Early detection is critical to save lives.
I built a project using the Kaggle Stroke Prediction dataset, applying ML algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict stroke risk based on patient features such as age, hypertension, glucose level, BMI, and smoking status.
As a BS Artificial Intelligence student, I am passionate about exploring ML & DL to solve real-world healthcare challenges.
